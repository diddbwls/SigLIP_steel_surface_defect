  "crazing": [
    "1. \"A photo of a large steel surface displaying a network of fine, spiderweb-like cracks, a classic example of crazing caused by extreme thermal stress.\"",
    "2. \"An image of a steel exterior, its once-smooth surface now marred by a pattern of delicate, interconnected lines, indicative of crazing due to temperature changes.\"",
    "3. \"A close-up photograph of a metallic surface where you can see a multitude of tiny, hairline cracks, resembling shattered glass, a phenomenon known as crazing.\"",
    "4. \"A high-resolution image of a piece of steel with a fascinating but unwanted pattern of fine fractures, a clear demonstration of crazing brought about by thermal discrepancies.\"",
    "5. \"A detailed picture of a steel structure, its surface etched with a dense network of minute, branching lines, visually representing the defect known as crazing.\""
  ],
  "patches": [
    "1. \"A photo of a large, flat piece of steel, its polished surface marred by irregular, discolored patches. The patches are rough to the touch, breaking the uniformity of the steel's otherwise smooth texture.\"",
    "2. \"A photo of a steel object showcasing a surface full of inconsistencies. There are spots where the surface color has changed, forming rough patches that are distinctly different from the surrounding area.\"",
    "3. \"A photo of a metallic sheet of steel with an uneven surface. Discolored blotches are scattered randomly across the surface, disrupting the steel's sleek appearance with their rough texture.\"",
    "4. \"A photo of a steel wall, its sheen interrupted by numerous irregular patches. These patches are visibly discolored and rough, standing out against the steel's normal, smooth finish.\"",
    "5. \"A photo that captures a close-up view of a steel plate. The surface of the steel is not even; it's dotted with discolored, rough patches, creating a stark contrast with the rest of the glossy, smooth material.\""
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. \"A photo of a large, tarnished metal sheet, the surface scarred with numerous corrosion-induced small holes. The pits are irregular in shape, showing the harsh effects of time and weather on the once smooth surface.\"",
    "2. \"A photo of a weather-beaten metallic surface, its once gleaming finish now marred by small pits. The holes are scattered across the surface, a testament to the relentless onslaught of corrosion.\"",
    "3. \"A photo of a rugged, pitted surface of an old metal sheet, its once polished exterior now riddled with tiny indents. The indentations are of varying sizes, a clear sign of corrosive damage.\"",
    "4. \"A photo of a once shiny metal sheet, now marked with numerous small holes caused by corrosion. The pitted surface is rough to the touch, bearing the scars of a battle with the elements.\"",
    "5. \"A photo of a metal surface, peppered with small pits scattered unevenly across its area. The pits, a byproduct of corrosion, give the surface a rugged, weathered look, a stark contrast to its original smooth finish.\""

  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "1. A photo of a steel surface, its metallic sheen marred by the presence of rolled-in scale. The defect appears as dark, irregular patches where the oxide scale has been forcibly embedded into the hot-rolled steel during the manufacturing process.",
    "2. A photo of a silvery steel plate featuring a unique texture: a series of rolled-in scales. The oxide scale defects manifest as rough, discolored spots, contrasting against the otherwise smooth and shiny steel surface.",
    "3. A photo of a large sheet of hot-rolled steel, its surface blemished by embedded oxide scales. The scales are pressed into the steel, creating a pattern of dark, rough patches that disrupt the uniform metallic appearance.",
    "4. A photo of a hot-rolled steel surface under bright light, highlighting the rolled-in scale defects. The oxide scale appears as uneven, dark blotches, starkly contrasting the steel's general silvery-grey hue.",
    "5. A photo of a steel beam, hot off the rolling line, bearing the characteristic marks of rolled-in scale. The oxide scales, pressed into the metal surface, appear as a series of dark, gritty spots against the shiny steel background."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "1. \"A photo of a shiny steel sheet marred by a series of long, jagged scratches. The scratches crisscross the surface in an irregular pattern, disrupting the smooth, reflective finish with their rough, uneven texture.\"",
    "2. \"A photo of a pristine steel sheet with a single, deep scratch running diagonally across it. The scratch is noticeable against the otherwise flawless surface, its jagged edges catching the light differently and creating a distinct line of contrast.\"",
    "3. \"A photo of a polished steel sheet under direct light, revealing a network of fine scratches. These hairline abrasions crisscross the surface, creating a subtle pattern that detracts from the sheet's original shine.\"",
    "4. \"A photo of a steel sheet with a collection of random scratches scattered across its surface. The scratches vary in length and depth, creating a chaotic pattern of light and dark lines against the steel's silvery-grey background.\"",
    "5. \"A photo capturing a close-up view of a steel sheet. A prominent scratch, deep and rough, splits the image in two. It is a stark defining mark on an otherwise smooth surface, its jagged path reflecting light differently and unveiling its depth and severity.\""
