  "crazing": [
    "A photo of a large steel surface under bright light, showing a network of fine, intricate cracks spreading across its entirety. The web of fractures is a result of thermal stress, giving the once smooth surface a weathered, marred appearance indicative of crazing.",
    "A close-up image of a steel component where the surface is visibly affected by crazing. Tiny, hairline cracks spiderweb across the metal, betraying the damaging effects of intense temperature fluctuations.",
    "A photograph of a steel beam, its surface marred by countless minute fractures. The intricate pattern is reminiscent of cracked glass, a classic example of the phenomenon known as crazing.",
    "An image showcasing a piece of steel structure that has undergone crazing. The surface displays a complex matrix of fine cracks, creating a fascinating, yet alarming, mosaic indicative of thermal stress.",
    "A macro shot of a steel surface, the sheen of the metal disrupted by an intricate network of minuscule cracks. This telltale pattern, often likened to shattered glass, is a clear sign of crazing due to thermal stress."

  "patches": [
    "A photo of a large sheet of steel with a glaring irregularity. The normally smooth, silvery surface is disrupted by a discolored patch that stands out starkly. The patch has a rough, uneven texture, unlike the rest of the steel surface, and is tinted with an unnatural hue, hinting at surface defects.",
    "A photo of a steel beam under bright lighting that highlights its surface defects. Among the uniform gray surface, you can spot several rough patches, each with a distinct discoloration. The patches are scattered randomly across the beam, breaking the symmetry of the otherwise pristine metallic beam.",
    "A photo of a close-up view of a steel plate, focusing on a specific defect area. A rough, discolored patch is clearly visible. The patch exhibits an irregular surface, contrasting with the smooth, polished steel around it. The patch appears almost like a scar on the steel's surface, indicating a surface defect.",
    "A photo of a steel pipe with an irregular surface. In the middle of the otherwise shiny pipe, there is a rough patch that stands out due to its discoloration. The patch's texture is visibly uneven, and it interrupts the uniformity of the steel's surface, indicating a possible defect.",
    "A photo of a steel surface under a microscope, highlighting the defects at a microscopic level. The magnified image reveals a rough, discolored patch contrasting with the rest of the smooth, metallic surface. The patch, exhibiting an irregular texture, suggests a surface defect in the steel."

  "pitted_surface": [
    "A photo of an exposed metal sheet, its once smooth surface now marred by numerous tiny holes, scars of corrosion-induced damage. The pitted surface, resembling a miniature moonscape, reflects light unevenly due to the numerous indentations.",
    "A photo of a metallic surface impacted by the harsh elements, resulting in a pitted texture. The small pits, caused by corrosion, seem to form random patterns, transforming the once sleek exterior into a rough, dappled appearance.",
    "A photo of an old, weather-beaten metal sheet. Its surface is no longer flat and shiny but has succumbed to corrosion, resulting in a multitude of minuscule holes and pits scattering across the surface, providing a visual testament to the relentless force of time and elements.",
    "A photo of a metal surface that has been through a lot. The corrosion-induced pits punctuate it, giving it a somewhat rugged appearance. The light hitting the surface reveals a constellation of small holes, each telling a story of gradual wear and tear.",
    "A photo of a corroded metal sheet. The tiny holes and pits caused by corrosion are scattered across the surface, giving it a distinctive, weathered texture. The pitted surface, once smooth and shiny, now speaks of time and exposure to unforgiving conditions."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "A photo of a sheet of hot-rolled steel on a workbench, its once smooth surface marred by the presence of rolled-in scale. The embedded oxide scale forms irregular, dark spots that disrupt the uniform metallic sheen, appearing as if they have been forcibly pressed into the material.",
    "A photo of a hot-rolled steel slab, glistening under the industrial lights. Across its surface, noticeable rolled-in scale defects are scattered. These imperfections stand out, with a distinct rusty color contrasting with the steel's silver hue.",
    "A photo of a close-up view of a hot-rolled steel surface, where rolled-in scale defects are clearly visible. The oxide scale, seen as rough, darkened patches, interrupts the otherwise smooth and shiny steel surface, indicating a pressing process gone awry.",
    "A photo of a large hot-rolled steel sheet. The steel's surface is pockmarked by the presence of rolled-in scale defects. These flaws, appearing as embedded, dark, irregular spots, serve as testament to the oxide scale that has been forcefully integrated into the steel during the rolling process.",
    "A photo of a hot-rolled steel beam, its long surface marred by the unmistakable signs of rolled-in scale. The embedded oxide scale, appearing as dark, rough patches, disrupts the steel's uniform sheen, showing that the steel's surface has suffered from defects during the fabrication process."

  "scratches": [
    "A photo of a glossy steel sheet, with noticeable linear abrasions running across its shiny surface, disturbing the uniform reflection of light off its otherwise pristine finish.",
    "A photo showcasing a close-up view of a stainless steel sheet, revealing a series of sharp, rough scratches that form a chaotic pattern, marring the cool, smooth surface of the metal.",
    "A photo of a large, metallic steel sheet under bright light, where the illumination brings to focus a series of long, thin scratches, slightly rusted at the edges, resembling claw marks from some wild animal.",
    "A photo of a polished steel sheet, its glossy surface marred by a web of scratches, each abrasion a linear mark that interrupts the metallic sheen, making a stark contrast between the damaged and undamaged parts.",
    "A photo capturing a steel sheet under soft daylight, with several deep scratches cutting across the surface, their jagged edges catching the light, starkly standing out against the otherwise smooth and shiny surface."
