  "crazing": [
    "A photo of a large steel surface under bright light, showing a network of fine, intricate cracks spreading across its entirety. The web of fractures is a result of thermal stress, giving the once smooth surface a weathered, marred appearance indicative of crazing."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "A photo of a close-up view of a steel plate, focusing on a specific defect area. A rough, discolored patch is clearly visible. The patch exhibits an irregular surface, contrasting with the smooth, polished steel around it. The patch appears almost like a scar on the steel's surface, indicating a surface defect."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "A photo of a metal surface that has been through a lot. The corrosion-induced pits punctuate it, giving it a somewhat rugged appearance. The light hitting the surface reveals a constellation of small holes, each telling a story of gradual wear and tear."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "A photo of a large hot-rolled steel sheet. The steel's surface is pockmarked by the presence of rolled-in scale defects. These flaws, appearing as embedded, dark, irregular spots, serve as testament to the oxide scale that has been forcefully integrated into the steel during the rolling process."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "A photo of a polished steel sheet, its glossy surface marred by a web of scratches, each abrasion a linear mark that interrupts the metallic sheen, making a stark contrast between the damaged and undamaged parts."
