  "crazing": [
    "2. A photo of a close-up view of a steel beam that has been subjected to extreme heat. The surface shows a beautiful, almost artistic, pattern of crazing. The fine cracks sprawl across the surface like a network of veins, a stark reminder of the metal's thermal stress."
  ],
  "patches": [
    "3. An image showcasing a steel surface that has been blemished by a series of irregular patches. Each patch looks rough and discolored, varying in size and shape, and stands out against the rest of the steel's shiny, smooth surface."
  ],
  "pitted_surface": [
    "1. A photo of a rusted metal sheet, its once smooth surface now marred and scarred with countless small, corrosion-induced holes. These pits vary in size, some barely visible to the naked eye and others larger, creating a rough, textured appearance that disrupts the sheet's uniformity."
  ],
  "rolled-in_scale": [
    "2. A photo capturing the close-up details of a hot-rolled steel surface marred by rolled-in scale. The defects are clearly visible; dark, oxidized patches, seemingly pushed into the steel, disrupting the uniformity of the silvery, lustrous surface."
  ],
  "scratches": [
    "3. A photo of a steel sheet with a glossy finish, marred by a cluster of fine scratches. They run in parallel lines, distorting the sheet's reflective quality. The scratches appear to be recent, as they still hold tiny steel particles within."
